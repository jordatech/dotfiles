#Purpose:   Add global environmental variables 


#

# your project folder that we can `c [tab]` to
export PROJECTS=~/workspace
export WORKSPACE=~/workspace

# Stash your environment variables in ~/..bashrc.local. This means they'll stay out
# of your main dotfiles repository (which may be public, like this one), but
# you'll have access to them in your scripts.
if [[ -f ~/.bashrc.local ]]; then
  source ~/.bashrc.local
